## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for:
  - Groq API (for LLaMA-3)
  - Speech-to-text service
  - Text-to-speech service

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mlwithharsh/EchoV1-emotional-ai.git
   cd EchoV1-emotional-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
SPEECH_TO_TEXT_API_KEY=your_stt_api_key_here
TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API_KEY=your_tts_api_key_here
```

## 📖 Usage

### Voice Interaction
1. Click the microphone button
2. Speak your message clearly
3. Echo V1 will process your emotion and respond accordingly
4. Listen to the empathetic audio response

### Text Interaction
1. Type your message in the text input field
2. Press Enter or click Send
3. Receive an emotionally aware text response
4. Optionally play the audio version

### Example Interactions

```
User: "I'm feeling really stressed about my exams tomorrow."
Echo V1: "I can hear the worry in your message. It's completely normal to feel stressed before important exams. Remember, you've prepared for this, and stress often means you care about doing well. Take some deep breaths, and trust in your preparation. You've got this! 💪"

User: "I just got a promotion at work!"
Echo V1: "That's absolutely wonderful news! 🎉 I can feel your excitement, and you should be incredibly proud of this achievement. Your hard work has clearly paid off. How are you planning to celebrate this milestone?"
```
